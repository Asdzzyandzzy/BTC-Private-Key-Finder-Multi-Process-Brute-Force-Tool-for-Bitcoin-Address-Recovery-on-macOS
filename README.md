## Overview  

BTC Private Key Finder is a multi-process brute-force tool designed to help users recover lost Bitcoin private keys from a list of owned Bitcoin addresses. The tool is optimized for macOS and leverages multiprocessing and the secp256k1 cryptographic library for high-speed performance.  

---

## Features  

- **Optimized for macOS**: Leverages macOS multiprocessing capabilities for efficiency.  
- **Supports Large Address Sets**: Loads Bitcoin addresses from a file and performs quick lookups using a set.  
- **High Performance**: Uses secp256k1 for cryptographic operations and multiprocessing to maximize speed.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides performance metrics, including attempts per second and time elapsed.  
- **Mainnet Address Compatibility**: Generates addresses suitable for Bitcoinâ€™s main network.

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x installed on macOS  
- `pip` (Python package manager)  

### Steps  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/btc-private-key-finder.git
   cd btc-private-key-finder


2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install secp256k1 base58 numpy
   ```

3. **Prepare the Address File**:
   Create a text file named `pure_addresses.txt` in the project directory. Add one Bitcoin address per line, like so:
   ```
   1ExampleBitcoinAddress1
   1ExampleBitcoinAddress2
   ```

---

## Usage

### Configure the Address File Path:

Open the `main.py` file and ensure the path to the `pure_addresses.txt` file is correct:
```python
address_file = "/path/to/pure_addresses.txt"
```

### Run the Tool:

Execute the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Monitoring Progress:

The tool will generate random private keys and test them against the provided addresses.
Progress logs will include:
- Time elapsed.
- Number of keys tested per second.
- Alerts if a matching private key is found.

### Example Output:

If a match is found, it outputs:
```plaintext
[Matching Address Found] Address: 1ExampleBitcoinAddress
[Private Key (Hex)] e1f30b7b1f3e1a9ff1c50eac22f12ab6e82e49f1ec90c2d8ad3d4b82eb3d3b8a
```

## Performance

- **Full CPU Utilization**: By default, the tool uses all available CPU cores for maximum throughput.
- **Configurable Rounds**: Adjust the number of private keys tested per process in `main.py` for your hardware.
- **Real-Time Logs**: Logs key testing speed, time per round, and other performance metrics.
